NAME AND COUNTRY

This is a popular game in my country. I used to play it in Malay and English when I was in school, but I am not sure if children now are still playing. I personally think this is a good game because I looked for map and dictionary when I was free in order to win! This game can be played by more than one person, or in big groups.

Divide a piece of paper into 6 columns.
Column 1-Name, Column 2- Country, Column 3-Animal, Column 4-Fruit, Column 5- Thing and Column 6-Points
The first player choose an alphabet. Everyone then fill up the columns with an answer which starts with the chosen alphabet. For example, alphabet ‘M’ is chosen, I write Mark, Malaysia, Monkey, Mango, Mat.
Award 10 points for each correct answer. However, if more than one person give the same answer, the players with the same answer get 5 points (half). I don’t know what is the name of this game. I called it Name & Country (Nama & Negeri in Malay). I played this game with my students and they got particularly excited when alphabets like ‘Q’ and ‘X’ were chosen.
